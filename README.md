## Initiate Submodules

This blog uses the [hello-friend theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend/)

To build locally, you'll need to run: `git submodule update --init`

## Run Locally

### Mac

`brew install hugo`

### Server

`hugo server`

`hugo server --buildDrafts` to build new posts.

## New Post

`hugo new posts/<post-path>/index.md`

`post-path` is whatever you want the path to be in the url. This will become the folder name and also be the title in the `index.md`. Keep this simple and then change the title to whatever you want.
