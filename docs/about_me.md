# About Me
![Placeholder](images/me.jpg)
I'm a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at [Lessonly](https://www.lessonly.com/). I love learning about new things and sharing what I’ve learned through writing and teaching. My writing puts a strong emphasis on audience with thoroughly researched arguments and ideas. I’ve worked on blog campaigns for technical nonprofits, curriculum creation for coding bootcamps, and informational how-to articles for a variety of tech companies.

I’m a former teacher turned programmer. I have over ten years experience teaching in classrooms, from primary school literacy programs, to adult technical education, to college level essay and research courses. I have a passion for learning how things work and sharing what I've learned with others. 

I'd love to work with you on creating strong, in depth and easy to follow product documentation and tutorials with a focus on an audience of developers.
