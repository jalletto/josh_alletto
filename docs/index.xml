          I had a lot of files on a server that needed to be renamed. At first I would just write a script to rename them. But soon this got really tedious. On my Mac I have a program called Transmino to do batch renaming of files. It let&amp;rsquo;s you find and replace in hundreds of files at once, use regex expressions, set prefixes, number files and way more. It&amp;rsquo;s great, but it&amp;rsquo;s graphical, and only for Mac.

          One Christmas long ago my brother and I got a Sega Genesis. We were thrilled and lost our shit. But as soon as all the jumping around with joy had ended, my first impulse was not to run to the TV to set it up. What I really wanted to do was call my best friend Tom so I could tell him about it, because talking about a new toy is sometimes just as fun as playing with it.

           I like to write, and code, and write about coding.

          Let&amp;rsquo;s Learn About Systemd Units # Lastly, since I know you were wondering what happens if you run sudo kill -9 1, I can tell you that on an Ubuntu EC2 machine, it does not trigger kernel panic or cause an explosive fire at Amazon, which is a bummer.
Postgres Row-Level Security in Python and Django # What&amp;rsquo;s nice about RLS is that if a user tries to select or alter a row they don&amp;rsquo;t have access to, their query will return 0 rows, rather than throwing a permissions error.
