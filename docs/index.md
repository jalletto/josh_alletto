** I've provided technical writing services to all sorts of technology based or technology focused organizations including not for profits, open source projects, and startups. **

Sharing technical knowledge through writing is [something Iâ€™m very passionate about](https://draft.dev/learn/posts/technical-tutorials). As a Site Reliability Engineer, I am constantly learning new things and I know a huge factor in whether or not my colleagues and I adopt a new technology is the quality of its documentation. 

With over ten years experience as a teacher and curriculum creator and over six years in the tech industry, I know how to create easy to understand, useful documentation and tutorials that have a developer focused audience.

Whether you're hoping to target an audience of professionals or complete novices, I can help you create documentation and tutorials that will help bring in users and keep them long term.
