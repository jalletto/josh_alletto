Sharing technical knowledge through writing is [something Iâ€™m very passionate about](https://draft.dev/learn/posts/technical-tutorials). As a Site Reliability Engineer, I am constantly learning. I know a huge factor in whether or not my colleagues and I adopt a new technology is the quality of its documentation. 

With over ten years experience as a teacher and curriculum creator and over six years in the tech industry, I know how to create easy to understand, useful documentation and tutorials that have a developer focused audience.
