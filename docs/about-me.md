# About Me
![Placeholder](images/me.jpg)
I'm a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at [Lessonly](https://www.lessonly.com/). I love learning and sharing what Iâ€™ve learned through writing and teaching. 

cMy writing puts a strong emphasis on audience with thoroughly researched arguments and ideas. Past projects I've worked on include: blog campaigns for technical nonprofits, curriculum creation for coding bootcamps, and informational how-to articles for a variety of tech companies.

I'd love to work with you on creating strong, in depth, and easy to follow product documentation and tutorials with a focus on an audience of developers.
