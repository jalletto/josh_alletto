          One Christmas long ago my brother and I got a Sega Genesis. We were thrilled. But as soon as all the jumping around with joy had ended, my first impulse was not to run to the TV to set it up. What I really wanted to do was call my best friend Tom so I could tell him about it, because talking about a new toy is sometimes just as fun as playing with it.
